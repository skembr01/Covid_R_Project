In this project, I utilized data obtained from Johns Hopkins University to analzye COVID-19 and its effects within the United States and Sweden at the time. These two countries were chosen given their differing approaches to the pandemic. Further, vaccines and their effects were analyzed for each country. Visualizations were provided all of these areas.
